## Usage

AFM Trade Forex Software provides various functions for trading automation and customization. The main functions include:

- `openTrade()`: Opens trades based on the implemented algorithms.
- `closeTrade()`: Closes trades based on the implemented algorithms.
- `modifyAlgorithms()`: Allows users to customize and modify the algorithms.
- `handleErrors()`: Handles exceptions and errors during trade execution.

To get started, initialize the software by calling the `OnInit()` function. The compliance with regulatory bodies is checked, and if the check fails, an error message is printed, and the initialization is aborted. If the compliance check is successful, the amplitude-phase modulation algorithm is executed, followed by opening and closing trades based on the implemented algorithms. Users can also customize and modify the algorithms as needed. Error handling is implemented to ensure smooth trade execution.

## Customization and Flexibility

AFM Trade Forex Software provides flexibility and customization options to meet individual trading preferences. The `modifyAlgorithms()` function allows users to customize and modify the implemented algorithms according to their trading strategies. By adjusting the parameters and logic within the algorithms, traders can optimize the software's performance to align with their specific trading goals.

The `handleErrors()` function is responsible for catching and handling exceptions and errors that may occur during the trading process.
